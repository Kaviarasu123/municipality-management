            <p class="mt-5">There are several organizations which provide the facility of raising complaints, in which
                each of the
                organizations differ from each other in their type of complaint. These organizations define the type of
                services related to the complaint provided by them for customers. So, we can say that the definition of
                type
                of complaint differ as the services provided by various organizations are different. The meaning of
                customer
                complaint is nothing but the customer dissatisfaction and this is also considered as the form of market
                feedback.On the other hand, customer’s complaint management is considered the key role for
                organization’s
                success. The complaint management system acts as the survey for the customer’s feedback about the
                organization. There are several organizations which consider the customer complaints as opportunities
                for
                their organization’s development. </p>

            <p class="mt-5">Many of the water systems that keep ecosystems thriving and feed a growing human population
                have become stressed. Rivers, lakes and aquifers are drying up or becoming too polluted to use. More
                than half the world’s wetlands have disappeared. Agriculture consumes more water than any other source
                and wastes much of that through inefficiencies. Climate change is altering patterns of weather and water
                around the world, causing shortages and droughts in some areas and floods in others.

                At the current consumption rate, this situation will only get worse. By 2025, two-thirds of the world’s
                population may face water shortages. And ecosystems around the world will suffer even more.</p>
